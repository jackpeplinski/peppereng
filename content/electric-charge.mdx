- Charges are either positive ($+$) or negative ($-$).
- Unlike charges attract each other; like charges repel each other.
- Particles—which are composed of charges—are either positive, negative, or neutral (an equal balance of positive and negative charges).
- Protons have positive charge, electrons have negative charge, and neutrons do not have any charge.

# FAQ
<Dropdown 
  title="How do we know charge exists?" 
  body="People have been able to observer charges since ancient times. The first know example was by the Greeks who noted polishing amber temporarily enabled it to attract straw. Later, and with much more investigation, scientists determined charge was physical property of matter."
/>
<Dropdown
  title="How are nuetrons nuetral?"
  body="All atomic particles contain subatomic particles. These subatomic determine the charge of atomic particles. The subatomic particles in neutrons cancel out charges. These are not discussed because they are a more complex topic."

<Dropdown
  title="What causes charge?"
  body="We're not entirely sure... like many things in physics we know it's there but we don't know why!"
