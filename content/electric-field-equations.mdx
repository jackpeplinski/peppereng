- $\overrightarrow{E} = $ electric field generated by $|q_{source}|$
- $|q_{test}| = $ magnitude of $q_{test}$
- $\overrightarrow{F} = $ electrostatic force on $q_{source}$ and $q_{test}$
- Assume $q_{test}$ produces both a negligible: 
  - electric field in its surroundings and
  - electrostatic force on $q_{source}$
- The strength of $\overrightarrow{E}$ is independt of $q_{test}$ 

# FAQ
<Dropdown 
  title = {<span>
    How are <InlineMath math={"q_{test}"}/> and <InlineMath math={"q_{source}"}/> different?
  </span>}
  body = {<span>
    Both <InlineMath math={"q_{test}"}/> and <InlineMath math={"q_{source}"}/> are charges. <InlineMath math={"q_{source}"}/> is a regular charge meaning it:
    <ul>
      <li>emits an electric field</li>
      <li>that electric field creates an electrostatic force on particle it encounters</li>
    </ul>
    Meanwhile, we assume <InlineMath math={"q_{test}"}/> does not:
    <ul>
      <li>emit an electric field</li>
      <li>without an electric field, an electrostatic force cannot be generated</li>
    </ul>
    <InlineMath math={"q_{test}"}/> is only a theoretical particle (it  could not exist in reality) that detect the electric field's strength.

<Dropdown 
  title = {<span>
    How can we assume <InlineMath math="q_{test}"/> produces both a negligible electric field and force on <InlineMath math="q_{source}"/>? Is there a relationship between the electric field-force, electric field, and Coulomb's Law formulas?
    How is the strength of <InlineMath math={CommonMathData.EVector}/> independent of <InlineMath math="q_{test}"/>?
  </span>}
  body = {<span>
    These three questions can all be answered similarly. Consider the following approaches:<br/>

    <ElectricFieldIndependence/>

<Dropdown

    How are the electric force-field formula and the electric field formula different?
  </span>}
  body = {<span>
    The electric field formula only requires the presence of source charge.<br/>
    <br/>
    Meanwhile, the electric field-force requires a source charge and a test charge. Even if the source charge is not mentioned in a question, a source charge must be present to generate the electric field the test charge is 'testing'.

# Problems

<Dropdown 
  title = {<span>
    True or False: Both a source charge and a test charge are required for an electric field to be present.
  </span>}
  body = {<span>
    False. A single source charge is capable of generating an electric field. The source charge's field would still exist without the presence of a test charge. A test charge just 'tests' the strength of the source charges field. 
  </span>}
/>

<Dropdown 
  title = {<span>
    True or False: The electric field strength of an electric field is dependent on the value of the test charge.
  </span>}
  body = {<span>
    False. Consider the following approaches:
    <ElectricFieldIndependence/>
    As shown, when substituting the expression for Coulomb's Law into the electric field-force equation, <InlineMath math="q_{test}"/> cancels demonstrating the magnitude of <InlineMath math="q_{test}"/> 
  </span>}

<Dropdown 
  title = {<span>
    Two charges are always required to experience an electrostatic force.
  </span>}
  body = {<span>
    True. Coulomb's Law defines the electrostatic force as: <BlockMath math={CommonMathData.coulombsLaw}/> Note the use of <InlineMath math={"q_1"}/> and <InlineMath math={"q_2"}/>. If there were not two charges, you could not evaluate the force using Coulomb's Law.
    <Divider/>
    You may be tempted to think you could use the electric field-force formula. However, examine the derivation:
    <DeriveElectricField/>
    Notice how the electric field-force equation uses Coulomb's Law—this creates a dependence on Coulomb's Law and Coulomb's Law requires two charged particles.<br/>
    <br/>
    Remember: <strong>it takes two (charged particles) to tango (experience an electrostatic force)!</strong>
  </span>}

<Dropdown 
  title = {<span>
    True or False: An electric field will always generate an electrostatic force.
  </span>}
  body = {<span>
    False. The question said '<i>always</i> generate an electrostatic force.' Coulomb's Law defines the electrostatic force as:
    <BlockMath math={CommonMathData.coulombsLaw}/>
    Note the use of <InlineMath math={"q_1"}/> and <InlineMath math={"q_2"}/>. If there were not two charges, you could not evaluate the force using 
    Coulomb's Law which is the basis for electrostatic force.<br/>
    <br/>
    The statement made no mention of two charges but only an electric field. An electric field can be generated by a single source charge.
  </span>}

<Dropdown 
  title = {<span>
    True or False: The strength of the electric field can be less than 0.
  </span>}
  body = {<span>
    False. The electric field is a vector so sometimes a negative sign may be used to indicate a direction.<br/>
    <br/>
    However, the actual strength (i.e. magitude or absolute value) of a electric field must always be greater than 0.<br/>
    <br/>
    Saying a negative electric field would be a bit like saying to make a square box of size -2m squared—it just wouldn't make sense.

<Dropdown 
  title = {<span>
    True or False: The electric-field force formula can be evaluated for any isolated single charge system (assuming relevant values of the system are given). 
  </span>}
  body = {<span>
    False.

    <strong>Logically:</strong>
      <img src={ElectricFieldEquations1}/> <br/>
      This diagram shows the most basic setup for the use of the electric-field force formula. Notice the following components:
      <ul>
        <li>electric field lines produced by the source charge</li>
        <li>the source charge</li>
        <li>the test charge</li>
        <li>the force acting on the test charge</li>
      </ul>
      There were two charges in the list—the source and the test. Therefore you would need at least two charges. <br/>
      <br/>
      If there was only the source charge, an electric field would be created, but you could not use the electric-field force formula without
      the test charge. Without a test charge, the electric field could not encounter a particle to create a force.<br/>
      <br/>
      If there was only the test charge, no electric field would be create. Remember, assume <InlineMath math={"q_{test}"}/> produces both a negligible:
      <ul>
        <li>electric field in the its surroundings and</li>
        <li>electrostatic force on <InlineMath math={"q_{source}"}/></li>
      </ul>
    <Divider/>
    <strong>Mathematically:</strong> 
    <DeriveElectricField/>
    Note the use of <InlineMath math={"q_1"}/> and <InlineMath math={"q_2"}/>. If there were not two charges, you could not evaluate the force using 
    Coulomb's Law which is the basis for electrostatic force.<br/>

    Two test charges, <InlineMath math={"q"}/> and <InlineMath math={"Q"}/> are placed an equal distance from a source charge generating an electric field directed outward.
    If <InlineMath math={"|q|<<|Q|, q<0,"}/> and <InlineMath math={"Q>0"}/>: comparing the force on <InlineMath math={"Q"}/>, <InlineMath math={"(F_Q)"}/>, and  
     <InlineMath math={"q"}/>, <InlineMath math={"(F_q)"}/>, then <InlineMath math={"F_q"}/> <InlineMath math={"\\underline{\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space 1 \\space\\space\\space\\space\\space}"}/> <InlineMath math={"F_Q"}/>,
      the magnitude of the force will be <InlineMath math={"\\underline{\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space 2 \\space\\space\\space\\space\\space}"}/>,
    and the sign of the source charge is <InlineMath math={"\\underline{\\space\\space\\space\\space\\space 3 \\space\\space\\space\\space\\space}"}/>. <br/>

    Correct answers are bolded:

    <InlineMath math={"1."}/> a) is greater than b) is lesser than <strong>c) is equal to</strong><br/>
    <br/>
    Consider the following approaches:<br/>
    <br/><ElectricFieldIndependence/> 
    <Divider/>
    <InlineMath math={"2."}/> <strong>a) positive</strong> b) negative c) zero <br/>
    <br/>
    Note the use of the word mangitude which also means the absolute value of the force. There will be a force, so it cannot be zero and absolute values are never negative.<br/>

    <InlineMath math={"3."}/> <strong>a) positive</strong> b) negative c) unable to be determined given the information <br/>

    The source charge is 'generating an electric field directed outward'.<br/>
    <br/>
    Outward electric fields indicate positive charges; inward electric fields indicate negative charges (out of positive; into negative).
