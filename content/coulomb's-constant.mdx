- $k$ is Coulomb's Constant
- $k$ is often written as a shorthand instead of the exact value, <InlineMath math={CommonMathData.coulombsConstant}/>
- $\epsilon_0$ (pronounced 'epsilon naught') is the electric constant. It is a measure of the capability of an electric field to permeate in a vaccum.
- <InlineMath math={CommonMathData.vacuumPermittivity}/>
